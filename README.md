# Digital Audio Equalizer

This project challenged us to build an audio equalizer capable of adjusting the amplitudes of different frequency ranges for audio input files. The final product must display the original and post-processing spectra for the audio file and must allow the user to play both the original and processed audio. Using MATLAB, a GUI was developed that fulfilled the project requirements.

The source code is in the `project/development` folder where the app can be loaded into the MATLAB App developer. Using the packaged application, MATLAB will automatically install the Equalizer where it can be found under the MATLAB Apps page. Sample WAV files have been included for convenience of testing. The final report documents our design process as well as the Equalizers extra features.

This project was completed as a requirement for ECE 460, Digital Signal Processing, for an undergraduate degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering.
